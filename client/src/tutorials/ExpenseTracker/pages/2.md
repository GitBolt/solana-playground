# Initialize Expense Context

#### 2.1 Defining `InitializeExpense` context

Our first context is to initialize an expense context in order to create the instruction that will create our expense entry on-chain. Scroll to Line 50 and check this:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(id : String)]
pub struct InitializeExpense<'info> {

    #[account(
        mut,
    )]
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,


    #[account(
        init,
        payer = authority,
        space = 8 
            + 8 // id
            + 32 // owner
            + (4 + 12) // merchant name
            + 8 // amount
            + 1, // bump
        seeds = [b"expense".as_ref(),authority.key().as_ref(),id.as_ref()], 
        bump
    )]
    pub expense_account: Account<'info, ExpenseAccount>,

    // Misc Accounts
    #[account(address = system_program::ID)]
    pub system_program: Program<'info,System>,
    #[account(address = solana_program::sysvar::rent::ID)]
    pub rent: Sysvar<'info, Rent>,
}
```
In this context, we're first getting the `id` from our instruction params. This part:
```rs
#[instruction(id : String)]
```
We're doing this to access the Id and pass it in one of the `seeds` of our `expense_account`. 

In order to derive expense account PDAs, we need a unique value, and that unique value is this Id which will help us update and get a specific expense account.

### Accounts

- Authority: This account has access to add/modify/delete the expense account. It refers to the user's public key, as a user should have control over their expense account.
- Expense Account: This is the actual expense account that will store our expense data.
- System Program: This is the Solana System Program that has ultimate control over all accounts. We don't have to worry about anything regarding this program, as the code remains the same.
- Rent: Rent is required to create accounts on Solana, similar to the System Program. We don't need to worry too much about it.

### Space Allocation
We are essentially using anchor [space reference](https://book.anchor-lang.com/anchor_references/space.html) to allocate the amount of bytes initializing each new expense will take. 
You can see the comments on the right side of each space number tells us what that space allocation is for.

This is all we need to initialize an expense account, let's see how to update it next.
