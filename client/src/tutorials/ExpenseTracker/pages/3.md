# Update Expense Context

Head over to line 80 and check this out:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(id : String)]
pub struct ModifyExpense<'info> {

    #[account(
        mut,
    )]
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,


    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [b"expense".as_ref(),authority.key().as_ref(),id.as_ref()], 
        bump=expense_account.bump
    )]
    pub expense_account: Account<'info, ExpenseAccount>,

    // Misc Accounts
    #[account(address = system_program::ID)]
    pub system_program: Program<'info,System>,
    #[account(address = solana_program::sysvar::rent::ID)]
    pub rent: Sysvar<'info, Rent>,
}
```

This is not too different from our initialize context. We're telling anchor that we will be reading and modifying the data in the account defined by the seeds of the expense account here. The seeds are same as `InitializeExpense` as we are modifying the same account initialized in the previous instruction.
We also make sure by using `pub authority: Signer<'info>,` that the address updating the expense account is also signer.

Let's see how to delete an expense by closing its account next.
