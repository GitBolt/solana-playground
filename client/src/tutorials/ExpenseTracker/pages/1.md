# Defining Expense Struct


We will define what values an expense account will store. The space allocated is calculated accordingly. Check Line 130.

```rs
#[account]
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct ExpenseAccount {
    pub id: u64,
    pub owner: PubKey
    pub mname: String,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

Let's go through each of these one by one:
- id: We're first defining a unique ID for our expense entries. This ID will be used to modify a particular expense in the future.

- owner: The owner value will come in handy when we fetch expense entries in the frontend. We can use the `memcmp` filter in the `getProgramAccount` method to get expense accounts of a particular public key. We will learn about it around the end of this tutorial.

- mname: This is the merchant name, stored as a string for our expenses.

- amount: This is simply the amount we spent.

- bump: Bump is the value that pushes PDAs off the ED25519 curve. PDAs do not have a private key; they must lie outside the curve. When we derive PDAs using `seeds` and `program id`, there is a chance that the PDA still lies on the curve. This bump kicks it off.

This is the *only* account we need to define in our program. Let's head over to the specific contexts which will be used in our instruction next.
